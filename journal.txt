TODOs:

- script to export PSD. think about best way to do this
	dig up GEOHERO code
	need to specify which layers to export separately, which to merge, which to ignore
	then, z-order, position/scale
	export to text file, with texture paths (relative to "Resources" folder)
		Resources.Load( texPath ) as Texture2D
- "dance" animation script for avatars. bounce back and forth?

- AI defend pcode:

quantize input and analyze..

be "greedy" about chords, ie. starting from a note, consider all notes after within THRESH to be a chord

for each note, roll dice for:
	- how quickly is it following previous note? SPD check
	- is it a different key? DEX check
	- how different is the timing from the previous note (ignore sustains)? RHY check
	- is it a chord? how many notes? CHO check
	- is it sustained? how long? SUS check

- Test on myself by randomly choosing an AI and see if I can figure it out.
