		<!-- Each value of noteValuePdf is the relative probability that a note
		will have the duration/spacing of a specific number of quantizations.
		Here, we have 16 quants per measure. So that means the 4th value of noteValuePdf
		corresponds to the probability of a quarter note (16/4), the second value correspondes
		to the probability of an eigth note (16/8), and so on. -->
